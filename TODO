rename brcoti to minibuild

building without sudo

build strategies
	move env setting into their respective classes
		(such as PIP_INDEX_URL)
	move proxy env setting into the build command loop

dependencies on non-ruby packages (esp rpms)
	when compiling an extension, run ldd on the .so to detect
	its runtime deps.

	Add rpm requirements to spec.requirements?

change ruby from proxy to mirror?
	provide a per-build instance that can hide/add packages

prep:
	after building, check the implicit dependencies (eg from
	Gemfile.lock) and make sure we can resolve them vs our own index

build-spec extensions:
	git-tag-pattern v%version or v%subst(.,_,%version)

support mirrored git repos

bundler:
 -	make the bundler command configurable

local compute
 -	add interactive_shell

add python-requires info to simple index

restricted network

Support maven/java
